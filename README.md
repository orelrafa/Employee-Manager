# OOP-Project
OOP course project :D

It's a very basic employee managment system that I made as the final course project. It's meant to show off all 
of the principles of OOP programming using Windows Form Application in Visual Studio, using the .NET framework.

How to use:
-The Home section is where you can save or load existing data of employees.
-You can see each departments employees by selecting the appropriate department in the Department section. 
-The Employee section allows you to view all company employees or edit/add new ones. 
-You can find an About section that shows off the entire inheritence Tree. 

Thank you for checking it out!
